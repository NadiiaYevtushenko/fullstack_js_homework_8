# Float and Margin Layout Example

This project demonstrates how to create a responsive layout using only `float` and `margin` properties in CSS. The following scenarios are implemented on the page:

1. **1 block left | 1 block right**
2. **1 block left | 3 block right**
3. **2 block left | 2 block right**
4. **3 blocks aligned to the right (two stacked vertically)**
5. **3 blocks centered (two stacked vertically)**

## HTML Structure

Each layout is organized in a `<div>` container with blocks styled using classes for left, right, and center alignment.

## CSS Styling

Only `float` and `margin` properties are used to achieve the layout. No `display: inline-block`, `flexbox`, or any other layout techniques are applied.
